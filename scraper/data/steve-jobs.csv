steve-jobs,page = 1,id = 14," In most people's vocabularies, design means veneer. It's interior decorating. It's the fabric of the curtains of the sofa.

That is what Macintosh is all about."
steve-jobs,page = 3,id = 57, The most compelling reason for most people to buy a computer for the home will be to link it to a nationwide communications network. We're just in the beginning stages of what will be a truly remarkable breakthrough for most people - as remarkable as the telephone.
steve-jobs,page = 3,id = 58," The over-all point is that new technology will not necessarily replace old technology, but it will date it. By definition. Eventually, it will replace it.

steve-jobs,page = 3,id = 72," Bottom line is, I didn't return to Apple to make a fortune. I've been very lucky in my life and already have one. When I was 25, my net worth was 00 million or so. I decided then that I wasn't going to let it ruin my life. There's no way you could ever spend it all, and I don't view wealth as something that validates my intelligence."
steve-jobs,page = 3,id = 73," For the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: 'If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?'

steve-jobs,page = 3,id = 74," I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life."
steve-jobs,page = 4,id = 75," I don't think I've ever worked so hard on something, but working on Macintosh was the neatest experience of my life. Almost everyone who worked on it will say that. None of us wanted to release it at the end. It was as though we knew that once it was out of our hands, it wouldn't be ours anymore."
steve-jobs,page = 4,id = 76," I have a great respect for incremental improvement, and I've done that sort of thing in my life, but I've always been attracted to the more revolutionary changes. I don't know why. Because they're harder. They're much more stressful emotionally. And you usually go through a period where everybody tells you that you've completely failed."
steve-jobs,page = 4,id = 77," I'll always stay connected with Apple. I hope that throughout my life I'll sort of have the thread of my life and the thread of Apple weave in and out of each other, like a tapestry. There may be a few years when I'm not there, but I'll always come back."

steve-jobs,page = 4,id = 79," We don't get a chance to do that many things, and every one should be really excellent. Because this is our life. Life is brief, and then you die, you know? So this is what we've chosen to do with our life."
steve-jobs,page = 4,id = 80, Woz is living his own life now. He hasn't been around Apple for about five years. But what he did will go down in history.
steve-jobs,page = 4,id = 81," Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work.

steve-jobs,page = 4,id = 83," You know, my main reaction to this money thing is that it's humorous, all the attention to it, because it's hardly the most insightful or valuable thing that's happened to me."
steve-jobs,page = 4,id = 84," I was worth about over a million dollars when I was twenty-three and over ten million dollars when I was twenty-four, and over a hundred million dollars when I was twenty-five and it wasn't that important because I never did it for the money."
steve-jobs,page = 4,id = 85," It's hard to tell with these Internet startups if they're really interested in building companies or if they're just interested in the money. I can tell you, though: If they don't really want to build a company, they won't luck into it. That's because it's so hard that if you don't have a passion, you'll give up."

What will it be able to do ten or 20 years from now, or 50 years from now?"

steve-jobs,page = 4,id = 89," Microsoft has had two goals in the last 10 years. One was to copy the Mac, and the other was to copy Lotus' success in the spreadsheet - basically, the applications business. And over the course of the last 10 years, Microsoft accomplished both of those goals. And now they are completely lost."
steve-jobs,page = 4,id = 90," That's been one of my mantras - focus and simplicity. Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it's worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains."

steve-jobs,page = 4,id = 95, Every once in a while a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything. It's very fortunate if you can work on just one of these in your career.... Apple's been very fortunate in that it's introduced a few of these.

steve-jobs,page = 5,id = 106," The system is that there is no system. That doesn't mean we don't have process. Apple is a very disciplined company, and we have great processes. But that's not what it's about. Process makes you more efficient."
steve-jobs,page = 5,id = 107," There's no other company that could make a MacBook Air and the reason is that not only do we control the hardware, but we control the operating system. And it is the intimate interaction between the operating system and the hardware that allows us to do that. There is no intimate interaction between Windows and a Dell notebook."
steve-jobs,page = 5,id = 108," So Mac OS X is cross-platform by design, right from the very beginning. So Mac OS X is singing on Intel processors, and I'd just like to show you right now.

We're going to use a pointing device that we're all born with - born with ten of them. We're going to use our fingers. We're going to touch this with our fingers.

steve-jobs,page = 5,id = 117, I feel like somebody just punched me in the stomach and knocked all my wind out. I'm only 30 years old and I want to have a chance to continue creating things.
