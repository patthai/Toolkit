Ursula K. Le Guin,page = 49,id = 1204," As you read a book word by word and page by page, you participate in its creation, just as a cellist playing a Bach suite participates, note by note, in the creation, the coming-to-be, the existence, of the music.

Ursula K. Le Guin,page = 49,id = 1210," Life rises out of death, death rises out of life; in being opposite they yearn to each other, they give birth to each other and are forever reborn.
